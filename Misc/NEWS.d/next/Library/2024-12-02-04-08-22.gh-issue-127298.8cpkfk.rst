:mod:`hashlib` now avoids emitting a message to stderr when used in custom
build or system environment excluding any of our otherwise guaranteed
available hash functions.  The ``algorithms_available`` attribute is now
updated to exclude algorithms that are not actually available at import time,
even if they are considered guaranteed in normal Python builds.  Use of
OpenSSL FIPS mode runtime configs and some combination of the build time
``--with(out)-builtin-hashlib-hashes`` configure option are examples of when
this could happen.
